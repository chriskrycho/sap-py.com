# Sap.py website

This is the public version control for the Sap.py website. I've built it in
Pelican because I don't much like WordPress and I already have an established
workflow for podcasts for [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) using
Pelican, so adapting it to a new show with the same tooling was pretty easy.
I've also taken this as the opportunity to build out a simple podcasting theme
for Pelican, which I'll be open-sourcing shortly.

Since a lot of the point of this learning-to-program podcast is to encourage
other new programmers, it seemed good to use open-source Python tools to build
the website!

Feel free to follow up with us by shooting an email to hello [at] sap-py.com!
