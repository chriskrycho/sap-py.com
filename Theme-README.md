# Pelican Podcasting Theme

This is a simple but highly functional and nice-looking Pelican theme for
podcasts. Using and customizing it is quite simple!

## Install

Clone or download a copy of this repository. The easiest place to install the
theme is in the root of your Pelican site. Then add the following to the
configuration in `pelicanconf.py`:

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.getcwd())
import podcasting_theme
```

This will add the `podcasting_theme.py` file's to the configuration so that it
is available for use with the theme, and points Pelican to the theme directory.

## Settings

There are three areas where the theme is designed to be customized:

  - Pelican settings
  - Stylesheet rules
  - Theme configuration
