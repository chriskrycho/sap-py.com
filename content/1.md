Jaimie continues her journey into the land of Python on Treehouse. A few of the
highlights:

  - Fun times with infinite loops, the command line, and `Ctrl-C`
  - Three-year-olds who pick up on the things their parents are talking
    about... sort of.
  - How there aren't necessarily *right* solutions to any given problem in
    programming.
