We catch up on what Jaimie has (and sometimes hasn't) been doing since October.

  - Learning about [classes] and [inheritance]
  - Having a hard time with [`self`]
  - Building a small role-playing game (and slaying some dragons along the way!)
  - Dealing with discouragement and the challenge of learning in limited amounts of time (with small children to take care of)
  - The value of support and having a physically-present person available to help when you get stuck
