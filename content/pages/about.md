Title: About
...

Put a girl and Python together and what do you get? True love, that’s what! Join
one sappy couple---software programmer Chris Krycho and writer-mom Jaimie
Krycho---as Jaimie trains with programs Codecademy and Treehouse for her first
foray into programming. Insights, a-ha moments, and antics ensue.

When Chris isn’t busy coding, you can find him training for half-marathons,
reading thick tomes, and writing things both technical and poetic. Jaimie is
usually chasing around 1- and 3-year-old mini-me’s, but might sneak into a
corner every once in awhile to pound out some sci-fi or fantasy fiction. They
both agree that Jesus is Lord, but disagree about the tastiness factor of
mushrooms and deviled eggs.
