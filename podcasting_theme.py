# Configure the audio base audio URL. The full URL will be constructed as a
# path starting with this URL. For example, if in the article metadata you
# specify the `audio` value as `episode/05.mp3`, and this value were set to
# `http://cdn.my-site.com`, the full URL used in the template would be
# `https://cdn.my-site.com/episode/05.mp3`. It may be helpful to override this
# value in the production configuration (publishconf.py) and use local URLs
# for development or for validating a show before publishing it.
